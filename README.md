Project Description
Women Who Work is a community-driven platform designed to support women who are re-entering the workforce after a career break. The website provides resources and a space for personal growth, skill development, networking, and mentorship to help women achieve their professional goals.

The Problem Statement
What ridiculous problem are you solving?
Many women struggle to re-enter the workforce after a career hiatus due to a lack of confidence, skills, and networking opportunities. Our platform provides the tools and community support to ease this transition and help women overcome these challenges.

The Solution
How are you solving it? Keep it fun!
We‚Äôve created a two-path solution:

Rebuild Path: A space for professional growth with mock interviews, workshops, and learning programs to rebuild careers.
Join Path: A community-driven platform where women can connect, create groups, find mentors, and support each other in their journey back to the workforce.
